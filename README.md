# Demand Forecast Demo

This repo contains a quick notebook I put together to demonstrate how you might be able to forecast consumer demand. It's largely based around the techniques used in FastAI for the Rossman challenge, although it was really written in response to the following blog post.

Some of the techniques used in this notebook are a bit sloppy with respect to preventing past/present information blurring together, but in general it should serve as a good starting point for anyone looking to model company internal demand.
