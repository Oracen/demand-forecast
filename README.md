# Demand Forecast Demo

This repo contains a quick notebook I put together to demonstrate how you might be able to forecast consumer demand. It's largely based around the techniques used in [FastAI for the Rossman challenge](https://course18.fast.ai/lessonsml1/lesson12.html) coupled with some traditional time series analysis, although it was really written in response to the [following blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-store-demand-forecasting-and-inventory-optimization-part-1-xgboost-vs-9952d8303b48).

Some of the techniques used in this notebook are a bit sloppy with respect to preventing past/present information blurring together, but in general it should serve as a good starting point for anyone looking to model company internal demand.
